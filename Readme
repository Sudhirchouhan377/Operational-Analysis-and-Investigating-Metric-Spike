Operational Analytics plays a pivotal role in modern data-driven organizations, enabling companies to move beyond static reporting toward real-time, actionable intelligence. The core objective of this project is to investigate anomalies and metric spikes across diverse operational areas, with a focus on identifying underlying drivers and providing strategic recommendations to enhance business performance.

The project will cover a wide range of areas, including user engagement, sales performance, marketing effectiveness, and more. You'll be provided with access to datasets containing user information, events data, and email engagement details.



## Dataset Overview
#### job_data with the following columns:
```job_id: Unique identifier of jobs``` 

```actor_id: Unique identifier of actor```

```event: The type of event (decision/skip/transfer)```

```language: The Language of the content```

```time_spent: Time spent to review the job in seconds```

```org: The Organization of the actor```

```ds: The date in the format yyyy/mm/dd (stored as text)```

#### ```users: Contains one row per user, with descriptive information about that user’s account.```

#### ```events: Contains one row per event, where an event is an action that a user has taken (e.g., login, messaging, search).```

#### ```email_events: Contains events specific to the sending of emails.```

## Analysis on Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis
In this case study, I worked with the "job_data" table, investigating job-related metrics.  Tasks includes calculating the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020, deriving the 7-day rolling average of throughput, analyzing the language share over the last 30 days, and identifying duplicate rows in the data.
## Key Questions Explored

### Jobs Reviewed Over Time
Objective: Calculateing the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.
### Throughput Analysis
Objective: Calculating the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second).
### Language Share Analysis
Objective: Calculating the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.
### Duplicate Rows Detection
Objective: Identifying duplicate rows in the data.

## Analysis on Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike
In this case study, I worked with three tables: "users," "events," and "email_events." Tasks involves measuring weekly user engagement, analyzing user growth over time, investigating weekly user retention, measuring weekly engagement per device, and analyzing email engagement metrics.

### Weekly User Engagement
Objective: Measuring the activeness of users on a weekly basis.

### User Growth Analysis
Objective: Analyzing the growth of users over time for a product.

### Weekly Retention Analysis
Objective: Analyzing the retention of users on a weekly basis after signing up for a product.

### Weekly Engagement Per Device
Objective: Measuring the activeness of users on a weekly basis per device.

### Email Engagement Analysis
Objective: Analyzing how users are engaging with the email service.
